# Salary Prediction Web App

**Special Thanks to Saher Mohammed for their significant contributions to this project.**

This project involves predicting salary categories based on various features using a pre-trained machine learning model. The following files are included:

- **Features.csv:** Dataset containing unique values for different features.
- **README.md:** This file with project documentation.
- **adult-income-pred.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook with exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and model selection.
- **adult.csv:** The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **model.pkl:** Pre-trained machine learning model stored as a pickle file.
- **py.py:** Python script using Streamlit to create a web app for deploying the model.
- **requirements.txt:** File specifying the project dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZiadMostafa1/Income-Salary-Prediction.git
   cd Income-Salary-Prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Web App:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run py.py
   ```

   Visit the displayed URL in your web browser to interact with the salary prediction web app.

## Usage

1. The Jupyter Notebook (`adult-income-pred.ipynb`) provides insights into data analysis, preprocessing, and model selection.

2. The Python script (`py.py`) uses Streamlit to create a user-friendly web app for predicting salary categories based on user input.

3. The pre-trained model (`model.pkl`) is used for making predictions in the web app.

4. Explore the dataset (`adult.csv`) for a better understanding of the data.

## Web App Usage

1. After running the web app, adjust sliders and dropdowns to input user-specific features.
2. Observe the predicted income category based on the selected features.
